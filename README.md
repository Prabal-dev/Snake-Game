# Snake-Game
Used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the game working. 
After you open the game, press any key to start the game. 
Use your four cursors keys-up, dowm, right and left- to control the direction of snake
You have to eat apples to grow the length of snake. 
If you touch any walls or if the snake collides with itself, the game will be over.
Game over message will be displayed, press any key to start playing game again. 
I used localstorage to store the high score.
